## Usage

Display readme for installed package:

```
$ npm install express
$ readman express
```

Display readme for package at current working directory:

```
$ readman
```

Display readme for global package:

```
$ readman -g npm
```

## CLI

#### `$ readman [--global | -g] [<module>]`

Displays man page for `<module>` (requiring it through the usual Node `require.resolve` algorithm) or for module at the current directory (stepping up into parent directories if needed).

With `-g` flag, module name is resolved globally instead of locally.

## Completions

Get completions for your shell from `completions` directory in this repo.
